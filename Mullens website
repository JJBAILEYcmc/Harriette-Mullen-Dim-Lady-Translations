                My honeybunch’s peepers are nothing like neon. Today’s spe-<br>
                cial at Red Lobster is redder than her kisser. If Liquid Paper is<br>
                white, her racks are institutional beige. If her mop were Slinkys,<br>
                dishwater Slinkys would grow on her noggin. I have seen table-<br>
                cloths in Shakey’s Pizza Parlors, red and white, but no such pic-<br>
                nic colors do I see in her mug. And in some minty-fresh mouth-<br>
                washes there is more sweetness than in the garlic breeze my<br>
                main squeeze wheezes. I love to hear her rap, yet I’m aware that<br>
                Muzak has a hipper beat. I don’t know any Marilyn Monroes.<br>
                My ball and chain is plain from head to toe. And yet, by gosh,<br>
                my scrumptious Twinkie has as much sex appeal for me as any<br>
                lanky model or platinum movie idol who’s hyped beyond belief.

                <strong>Dim Lady</strong><br>
                My honeybunch’s peepers are nothing like neon,  <br>
                Today’s specials are cheaper than the ozone,  <br>
                Her face is a mudslide of mascara.<br>
                Her complexion’s fine if you like yellow and pink.<br>
                If hairs be wires, they’re staple thin,  <br>
                Her plants don’t stink nor smell like jin.  <br>
                With apologies to your mother tongue,  <br>
                Her chest is chicken, her arms are dumb.  <br>
                I love to hear her honking sounds,  <br>
                But music has a sweeter round.  <br>
                I grant I never saw a goddess go,  <br>
                My dim lady trips the light rodeo.  <br>
                And yet, by heck, my love as rare  <br>
                As any sheila belched compare.
